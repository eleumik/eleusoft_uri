It includes also some URI-scheme specific helpers, for example for the `file:` scheme and the `jar:` scheme.\r\n\r\n[JAVADOC](http://eleumik.github.io/eleusoft_uri/javadoc/)\r\n\r\nTest Suite\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis library includes a JUnit test suite with almost 500 tests, many have been collected from many sources like the URI RFC 3986, the URI Mailing List (uri@w3.org) and other works, see [credits](#credits). \r\n\r\nThe test suite produces an HTML report at each run\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis library has been started before 2005, when servers could run a version of Java < 1.4 (only from Java 1.4 the java.net.URI class has been included in Java). There are mainly two implementations for the URI parser: one based on a modified version of `org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI` and one based on `java.net.URI`, also adapted (and one without fixes, for test comparison). Tests show less failures for the modified Apache implementation; for standard usage both versions are good enough.\r\n\r\nThe library has been used mainly to be able to be independent from the underlying implementations. It has been also a way to correct some issues present in known implementations: cross testing of different implementations has been handy for finding and fixing the bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBoth Maven and Ant are supported, a `pom.xml` and a `build.xml` file are provided, \r\n\r\nAnt: use `ant -Dmaven=1 jaronly` to create the jar, `ant -Dmaven=1 test` to compile and run the tests. Junit must be in the `lib` dir or its position must be specified with `-Djar.junit=....` when running tests.\r\n\r\nThis package should be compiled with Java 4. Can be compiled in Java < 4 skipping the java4 package.\r\n\r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nNo dependencies, Junit for testing. \r\n\r\nlicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nApache License 2.0\r\n\r\ncredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMartin Duerst\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2004Apr/0034.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/2004/04/uri-rel-test.html\r\n\r\nGraham Klyne\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2004Feb/0108.html\r\n\r\nAdam Costello\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2004Feb/0114.html\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2005May/0036.html\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2005May/0043.html\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6345409\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6338951\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4479463\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.fourthought.com/pipermail/4suite-dev/2006-June/002113.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
